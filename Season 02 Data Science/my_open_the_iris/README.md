## Description
How have you solved the problem?
I haven't any problim!


## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
sure, I have instaled Data Science tools Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Sklearn librares 


## Usage
How does it work?
This proiject vers simpe works! We are given the date of Irs flowers!
This data veriy smol! the data has 5 columns sepal-length, sepal-width, petal-length, petal-width and finly class as type of irs (target).
We need clasfire model. This model can predict when we give it irs flower sepal-length, sepal-width, petal-length, petal-width data!
this model can predict irs flower type! Irs flovers has tree type: versicolor, setosa, virginica. I have created sevral models! 
I have used sklearn DecisionTree, GaussianNB, KNeighbors, LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminant, and SVM clasfire models!
