## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The most difucl part is prediction part for me! I had a problim when I wrote boston_predict function.
So I hade problim andestending charts!

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
ofcourse, I have found stack overflow and google for sovde my probems! 

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
I have installed sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborin.

## Usage
How does it work?
Ther is I creted prediction model! This model can predict bostin hoses prices!
At the firs I load datest with pandas read_csv function. this function return data as dataframe.
Next, I have cread print_summarize_dataset function this function prind shape, head 10 rows from dataset and describe!
after I have readet clean_datset function this function drop rows when rows have NaN value! But our data veri clear.
Next I have creted print_histograms function this function require one param as pandas datfram and each columns print as histogram!
this histograms help me better understand each columns.
After I have created compute_correlations_matrix function this function return the each column together correlations! 
which value close to 1, it's hase strong correlation between the two variables.
Next I have plot each atribut ageins other with seaborin pairplot function! (It is take long time)
This plot help we andistendin better understand the relationships between columns.
After, I have created 





```
./my_project argument1 argument2
