## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
I have difficulty with visualizing data

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
While working on this project, I realized that I need to improve my knowledge of data visualization. 
As a result, I decided to learn about visualization techniques from the internet.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
I installed numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

## Usage
How does it work?
In this project, I worked with sklearn models. These models can predict whether Galaxy Bank will accept 
a personal loan for customers. I used several sklearn models for this purpose.
