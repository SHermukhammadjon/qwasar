## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

Basically, I have a problem with making a return in my function and receiving information from the terminal!

## Description
How have you solved the problem?

Of course learning how to solve a problem in programming!
I had to learn the write and read functions.
I also had to learn how to work with pointers and arrays.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

I used stdio.h, time.h, stdlib.h, unistd.h and my own mmind.h libraries!
I definitely used all the allowed printf, write, read, rand and srand, time, atoi functions!
I also used my own scode, sycle, wellp, misp, and input functions!

## Usage
How does it work?

This program accepts secret codes and rounds entered from the terminal after -c and -t symbols, and my scode and cysle functions! 
If no information is entered, my cysle function will return 10 and my scode function will return a random 4-character string from 0 to -> 8! cycle 
by the number of rounds received. Inside the loop, the input function takes 4 non-identical characters from the user, 0 to -> 8, consisting of 4 
characters. If the information is not entered correctly, it will ask to enter information again and "wrong input!" consil the record! secret 
code and the numbers entered by the user, the welp function counts equal signs and returns! if the value returned by the wellp function is equal to 4, 
the message "Congratz! You did it!" will be output to the console!

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
