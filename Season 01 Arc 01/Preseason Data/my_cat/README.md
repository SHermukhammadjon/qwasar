# Welcome to My Cat

## Task
The main problem I had was that when Gandalf tested, he kept adding extra 1 /n!

## Description
I solved the problem by removing the spaces on both sides of the answer given by the .strip() method!

## Installation
I installed the sys module in my code!

## Usage
If I enter the file name as an argument in the open() function, and the information inside the file can be obtained through the .read() method!
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
