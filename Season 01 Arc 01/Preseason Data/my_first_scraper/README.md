# Welcome to My First Scraper
***

## Task
The main challenge was learning the bs4 library!

## Description
As always, I wrote down the problems I encountered by printing out each line of my code!

## Installation
I used python's bs4 and request libraries in my program! 
I used the request() function of the request library and the BeautifulSoup() 
function of the bs4 library and the .fin_all() and .select_one() methods from 
these libraries!

## Usage
Scrapper software helps you get data from a website using the bs4 and request 
libraries! The Request library helps render a web page's html code in text view!
And the BS4 library helps us find the information we need!
