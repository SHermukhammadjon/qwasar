## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The main challenge I encountered was extracting audio features accurately.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
To solve the problem, I extensively researched Jupyter notebooks on Kaggle 
and also searched for relevant information on Google and YouTube on how to predict audio genres.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
I installed the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and librosa 
for working with audio data, as well as scikit-learn and TensorFlow for machine learning purposes.

## Usage
How does it work?
In this project, I first extracted 56 audio features using librosa. Then, I split the features into training and testing datasets, 
as well as additional data. Using these features, I trained several scikit-learn models and a TensorFlow neural network. 
Finally, I created a predictor pipeline that can predict the genre of audio files using their file paths.


```
./my_project argument1 argument2
