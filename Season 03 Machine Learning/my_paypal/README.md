## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The main challenge is balancing the dataset.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
I searched on Google to find ways to balance the dataset, and I discovered undersampling and oversampling techniques. 
I implemented these techniques to address the data imbalance.

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To install my project, you need to install the following packages: scikit-learn and TensorFlow for machine learning. 
Additionally, you'll need to install NumPy and pandas for working with datasets, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.

## Usage
How does it work?
In this project, I trained a TensorFlow model using a dataset of fraudulent transactions. 
The model can detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.


```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
